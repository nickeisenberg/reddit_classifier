i wish to apologize in advance for what i am about to do   i am about to enter a long position in nvda for the very first time  literally after a 1 year breathless sprint when there might be no more room left on the bandwagon   everything i touch turns to shit   i bought a bunch of puts on coin when it was around 75 and it’s gone on a swashbuckling bull run since then   i went long on tsla at 255 and it’s been a disappointing broken down piece of hasbeen shit since then   i bought 500 strike puts on smci which briefly experienced 300 gains but were promptly squashed by a doublebarreled rally fueled by a sp 500 listing   and there’s more but i won’t bore you with the details i just wanted to say sorry for fucking with your tendies i’m now about to put my inversemidas touch on the one engine that is powering this stockmarket up do what you wish with this info
who bought bitcorn at 68k come forward
if nvda goes to 900 this week i will have enough money to seriously consider not working anymore wish me luck
so amd will still be green despite the china news and the whole overnight drop of 35 was fake  got it
if you ever feel stupid just remember this people visit rwallstreetbets for advice and suggestions
it’s always  “fuck i shoulda bought more”  or  “fuck why did i buy that”  never  “damn i did a good job right there”
